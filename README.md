# Globant - Code Realm - Angular Assignment

## The current application

- View the Form
- Fill the input details.
- Submit the form.

## Points to implement

- Make the app responsive - The app isn't responsive and doesn't display correctly on mobile devices. Remove inline styles and write it in separate file.

- Make reusable component for label and input text.

- Make the app work with React Context to solve the problem of props drill.

- Rewrite FormField component with functional syntax.

- Add unit testcases for sufficient code coverage.

- Refactor and optimise the code.

- On Pressing Submit button try to show details in separate component.

- Do not use any thirdparty libraries for validations.

## Please note

- SCSS integration is already present so you don't have to add any custom packages or modify any configuration changes for it.

- The ability to execute unit tests is already baked in so you don't have to make any configuration changes to enable it.

- [ ] Array of objects in app.js and sort alphabetically names
- [ ] Filter gender wise
- [ ] Write unit tests

Good to have:

- [ ] Use React hooks
