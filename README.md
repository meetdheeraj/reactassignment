This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Problem Statement

The existing app is a simple form for which you can perform the following operations -

1.  View the Form
2.  Fill the input details.
3.  Submit the form.

You have to perform the following tasks -

1.  Make the app responsive - The app isn't responsive and doesn't display correctly on mobile devices. Remove inline styles and write it in separate file.

2.  Make reusable component for label and input text.

3.  Make the app work with React Context to solve the problem of props drill.

4.  Rewrite FormField component with functional syntax.

5.  Add unit testcases for sufficient code coverage.

6.  Refactor and optimise the code.

7.  On Pressing Submit button try to show details in separate component.

8.  Do not use any thirdparty libraries for validations.

Please note -

- SCSS integration is already present so you don't have to add any custom packages or modify any configuration changes for it.
- The ability to execute unit tests is already baked in so you don't have to make any configuration changes to enable it.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure that you have Node.js and npm v5 or above installed.

2. Clone this repo using git clone https://github.com/PiyushJha04/code-realm-react.git

3. Move to the appropriate directory: cd code-realm-react.

4. Run `yarn` in order to install dependencies.

5. At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at http://localhost:3000.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

Must to have:

- [ ] Form field validations
- [ ] Make it responsive
- [ ] On submit button there should be separate page which shows the details (React route )
- [ ] Add reset button
- [ ] Array of objects in app.js and sort alphabetically names
- [ ] Filter gender wise
- [ ] Write unit tests

Good to have:

- [ ] Use React hooks
- [ ] Use functional components

TODO :

- [ ] Reporter tool
