# Globant - Code Realm - React Assignment

## The current application

- View the Form
- Fill the input details.
- Submit the form.

## Points to implement

- Make the app responsive - The app isn't responsive and doesn't display correctly on mobile devices. Remove inline styles and write it in separate file.

- Make reusable component for label and input text.

- Make the app work with React Context to solve the problem of props drill.

- Rewrite FormField component with functional syntax.

- Add unit testcases.

- Refactor and optimise the code.

- On Pressing Submit button try to show details in separate component.

- Do not use any thirdparty libraries for validations.

## Please note

- SCSS integration is already present so you don't have to add any custom packages or modify any configuration changes for it.

- The ability to execute unit tests is already baked in so you don't have to make any configuration changes to enable it.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure that you have Node.js and npm v5 or above installed.

2. Clone this repo using git clone https://github.com/pragatir/reactassignment

3. Move to the appropriate directory: cd code-realm-react.

4. Run `npm install` in order to install dependencies.

5. At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at http://localhost:3000.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

Must to have:

- Form field validations
- Make it responsive
- On submit button there should be separate page which shows the details (React route )
- Add reset button
- Array of objects in app.js and sort alphabetically names
- Filter gender wise
- Write unit tests

Good to have:

- Use React hooks
- Use functional components
